  During my internship, I, Jose Paulo Mendoza, had the opportunity to work at Social Rhino Media, 
a Canadian-based company with an office located in San Fernando, Pampanga. My job within the company 
was content researcher and a graphics designer. This role allowed me to gain a experience understanding
of the media industry and develop a skills. One of the reasons I chose to intern at Social Rhino Media 
is because I already work there since 2021 and so that I would not have a conflict in my schedule. This helped 
me to gain exposure in a work environment and learned to socialize with different types of people.
